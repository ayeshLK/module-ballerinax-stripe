# They contain [invoice items](https://stripe.com/docs/api#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments
# that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).
# 
# If your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges,
# Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note
# that finalizing the invoice,
# [when automatic](https://stripe.com/docs/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does
# not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits
# until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last
# webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have
# connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after
# creation to finalize the invoice.
# 
# If your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your
# [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic),
# Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These
# emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.
# 
# Stripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the
# amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually
# charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe's [minimum allowed charge
# per currency](/docs/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the
# invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the
# customer's credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.
